h1. oath-ssh-command

Think of this as "authy-ssh":https://github.com/authy/authy-ssh but for OATH [TH]OTP.
So it works:
* offline (when you're cut of from the net but not from the machine you're ssh:ing into)
* without sending any authentication request to an external service.

h1. TODO
* Support HOTP
* Support other configuration files, like "pam_oath":http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/
