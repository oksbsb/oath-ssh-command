h1. oath-ssh-command

Think of this as "authy-ssh":https://github.com/authy/authy-ssh but for OATH [TH]OTP.
So it works:
* offline (when you're cut of from the net but not from the machine you're ssh:ing into)
* without sending any authentication request to an external service.

h4. Installation
# Build the code:
<pre><code>$ make</code></pre>
# Put the somewhere you want it to be, <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> is nice.
# In your <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> add:
<pre><code>command="/usr/local/bin/oath-ssh-command" ssh-rsa AAAAZOMGLOL[â€¦]== awesome key with OTP</code></pre>
# ssh into your machine with that key:
<pre><code>$ ssh awesome-machine
Verification code: 1337
$</code></pre>

h4. TODO
* Add tests
* Fix FIXME's in the code
* Support HOTP
* Support other configuration files, like "pam_oath":http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/. Currently it only works with the configuration file from "Google Authenticator PAM module":https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/.
